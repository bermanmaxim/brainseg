Created by Stavros Tsogkas at CentraleSupelec, Paris.

### Introduction

This code can be used to train and evaluate CNNs as described in our [paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01265500v1) published at ISBI 2016. You can also find links to download the [pre-computed probability maps](#download) for all the volumes in the [IBSR dataset](https://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=48) that we used in our experiments.

3. [Installation](#installation)
4. [Download pre-computed probability maps for IBSR](#download)

### Requirements: software

1. A recent version of MATLAB. All our experiments were performed using MATLAB 2014a and Ubuntu 14.04.
2. [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/) (tested with `v1.0-beta24`)
3. [NifTI tools](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image) for loading NifTI files.

### Requirements: hardware

Our model is small enough to be trained using Nvidia GTX980 GPUs, demanding around 3GB of GPU RAM. If you want to experiment with different architectures, you may need GPUs with more RAM (e.g. Nvidia Titan or Tesla K40). You will probably need a computer with a good amount of CPU RAM, at least 12GB or more, depending on the amount of data augmentation. 

### Installation

1. Clone the brainseg repository.
  
2. Clone my [utils](https://github.com/tsogkas/utils) and [matconvnet](https://github.com/tsogkas/matconvnet) repos. Install MatConvNet following the steps described [here](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/install/).

3. Download the [IBSR dataset](https://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=48). You will have to create a NITRC account, if you do not already have one. _In our experiments we used cropped versions of the original volumes. We do not make that version of the data available to avoid copyright violation. If you want access to the cropped data, please send us an email._ 

4. Create a folder `brainseg/data` (this can be a symlink), place the downloaded file inside and extract it. This will result in a `brainseg/data/IBSR_nifti_stripped` directory. 

_Make sure that_ `utils`, `matconvnet`, _and_ `NifTI tools` _are included in the MATLAB working path._
